            I have enjoyed photography since I was a kid. my dad was a 
            a photographer, and then he began video editing for companies
            so I have been around cameras, and photoshop/after effects
            my whole life.</p>
            <p> Last year I took a road trip all along the east coast from
            St. Louis all the way to boston, then down to Washington D.C.
            it was a great time, minus the 14 hour drive there and back.
